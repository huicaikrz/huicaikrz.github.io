### About me
I am now a second-year master's student in University of Michigan, Quantitative Finance and Risk Management Program. I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Finance Class in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Till now, I have done some internships in financial industry including developing quantitative trading strategies on options, using python to implement machine learning models to aid financial prediction, etc. For more details, see my [resume](https://rawgit.com/huicaikrz/HuiCai-Resume/master/Hui%20Cai%20-%20Resume.pdf).

### Python
I began to use Python in 2015, and started using it intensively on data analysis from 2016.5. I have also tried Matlab and R, but Python is my favourite. I have always been trying to write pythonic code (by using lambda, list comprehension,……), and I will consist on doing that.

Here's some of my python code I wrote in research or coursework.
