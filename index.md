### About me
I am a graduate student at University of Michigan, in the Quantitative Finance and Risk Management program. I finished my undergraduate work in Mathematics and Finance Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

I am still wondering what exact field should I focus on in quantitative fiance, derivatives, stocks, fixed income, risk management or some other? Until now, I have did some internship and research in this field including stock trading, risk management, time series analysis, for more details, see my [resume](https://rawgit.com/huicaikrz/huicai-cv/master/Hui%20Cai%20-%20CV.pdf)

In the long term, I want to go back to China to become a fund manager. I have always been wondered what I should learn and what will become the next opportunity. Machine learning on fintech? Blockchain? Should I learn sth. on market microstructure?  

### Python
I first studied Python in 2015, and started to use it densely on data analysis from 2016.6. I have also tried Matlab and R, but Python is my favourite. I have always been tried writing pythonic code (by using lambda, list comprehension,……), and I will consist on doing that in the near future.

#### Bootcamp
Here's some of my python code that I wrote during bootcamp (2017.8.21 - 2017.9.1).
