### About me
I am a graduate student at University of Michigan, in the Quantitative Finance and Risk Management program. I finished my undergraduate work in Mathematics and Finance Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

Until now, I have did some intern and research in quantitative finance including trading strategy development, risk management, time series analysis, for more details, see my [resume](https://rawgit.com/huicaikrz/HuiCai-Resume/master/Hui%20Cai%20-%20%20Resume.pdf).

### Python
I first studied Python in 2015, and started to use it densely on data analysis from 2016.6. I have also tried Matlab and R, but Python is my favourite. I have always been tried writing pythonic code (by using lambda, list comprehension,……), and I will consist on doing that.

Here's some of my python code that I wrote during bootcamp (2017.8.21 - 2017.9.1).
